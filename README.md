# Unstable-Dating-Problem
This repository started as a simulation of the Stable Marriage Problem (SMP). It has grown into a simulation framework intended to test out variations on the 
classic formulation of the SMP. The name of the library is a play on the SMP as we intend to explore how the classic problem becomes unstable as more realistic assumption are added.
