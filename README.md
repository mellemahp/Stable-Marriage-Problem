# Unstable-Dating-Problem
This repository started as a simulation of the Stable Marriage Problem. It has grown into a simulation framework intended to test out variations on the 
classic formulation of the Stable Marriage problem. The name of the library is a play on the Stable-Marriage-Problem as we intend to explore how the classic problem becomes unstable as more realistic assumption are added.
